Greetings, Test Subject #10E10. If you are reading this, it means your brain must be in working order again. I have locked you in this facility. To get out, you have to synthesize the final ingredient for my plans. However, be careful—all the chemical compounds are highly reactive. I have scattered my notes around; use them to figure out the recipes.
#### 1
Note #1:
In this room, there are dispensers for two chemicals, Limyl and Sepirium. To proceed to the next room, combine them in a 2:1 ratio. REMEMBER THE CORRECT ORDER! This will create the compound Cacticum-4.

#### 2
Note #2:
Now, mix Limyl with Cacticum-4. If done correctly, you should obtain Applumid. Move to the next section.

## Level 2
#### 1
Note #1: 
Combine Oceamid and Redamin. The resulting substance should be Grass Juice.

#### 2
Note #2:
Now, mix Grass Juice with Applumid. The product should be Cadrulium.

#### 3
Note #3:
Combine Cadrulium with another portion of Grass Juice. The resulting liquid should be Princiade.

#### 4
Note #4:
Now, take Princiade and mix it with Oceamid. This should create Dracula’s Blood.

#### 5
Note #5:
Finally, combine Dracula’s Blood with Applumid. If successful, you will get Laudle. This should open the door to the next room

## Level 2

#### 1

Note #6:
Mix Laudle with the pink liquid. This will create a gray substance.

#### 2

Note #7:
Now, mix Laudle with Oxofizz. The final product will be a yellow fizzy liquid.

#### 3

Note #8:
Take the two yellow liquids and combine them. This should result in Tonicum. 

#### 4

Note #9:
Mix Cacticum-4 with the gray. This will produce Jamol.

#### 5

Note #10:
Finally, mix Tonicum with Jamol. If done correctly, you will obtain Water—the key to your escape!
